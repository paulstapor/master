\chapter{Deformation quantization}

The starting point for every theory of quantization is surely mechanics. Here, 
mechanics means both, the classical and the quantum theory. Since we want to 
explain how one can link them together, we will give a short overview of both 
theories and show their similarities and their differences in the first section 
of this chapter. Then we will come to different aspects of quantization and 
state the most important ideas in the next part. In section three, we will 
focus on Deformation quantization and give an overview of this rather young 
theory.



\section{Mechanics: The Classical and the Quantum World}
\label{sec:chap2_Mechanics}

\subsection{Classical Mechanical Systems}
\label{subsec:chap2_Classical}
We want to recall briefly the notions of classical mechanics. There are many 
good books on this subject and also the notation is mostly uniform everywhere, 
but nevertheless want to refer to the books of Marsden and Ratiu 
\cite{marsden.ratiu:1999a} and Arnold \cite{arnold:1989a}, which give very good 
introductions and overviews of the whole theory.
Imagine the simplest model for a mechanical system, which is not trivial: a 
single particle with mass $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in a scalar potential $V$. We 
will denote his position by $q = (q^1, q^2, q^3) \in Q = \mathbb{R}^3$ and call 
the set of all possible positions $Q$ the configuration space. Since we also 
have a time coordinate $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we can describe the path on which 
the particle moves by $q(t)$. The state of the particle is completely described 
by its position and its velocity $(q(t), \dot q(t))$ and the velocity should be 
understood as a tangent vector $\dot q(t) \in T_{q(t)}Q = \mathbb{R}^3$. 
Therefore, the tangent bundle $TQ$, which is in this case $\mathbb{R}^6$, is 
sometimes called the state space. In classical mechanics, we can describe the 
movement of the particle with the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are derived 
from the Lagrange function by a variational principle. The Lagrange function of 
this system reads
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q)
	=
	T(q, \dot q) - V(q, \dot q)
\end{equation*}
and $T(q, \dot q) = \frac{1}{2} m  \sum_{i=1}^3 \dot{q^i}^2$ is the kinetic 
energy. The action 
is defined as the integral
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{S}(q, \dot q)
	=
	\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q)
	dt.
\end{equation*}
It is a physical observation, similar to a mathematical axiom, that this action 
functional is minimized along the trajectories of the particle. So fixing a 
starting point $q_0$ and an end point $q_1$ of a trajectory, we find
\begin{equation*}
	\delta \mathcal{S}
	\at{q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1}
	=
	0.
\end{equation*}
From this, one finds the Euler-Lagrange equations for $i = 1, 2, 3$
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} 
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot q^i}
	-
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i}
	=
	0.
\end{equation*}
In our case this means
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} 
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot q^i}
	-
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial q^i}
	=
	m \ddot q
	-
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial q^i}
	=
	0
\end{equation*}
and we can integrate the equations to get the trajectory. So far, we described 
the system in the state space and for obvious reasons, this formalism is called 
the Lagrange formalism. It is not the only formalism, which describes to 
behaviour of the system: one can go to the so called Hamilton formalism, which 
is based on the conjugate momenta $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3) \in T_{q(t)}^*Q$
\begin{equation*}
	p_i(t)
	=
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot q^i}
\end{equation*}
and linked to the Lagrange formalism by a Legendre transformation. Now we can 
define the Hamilton function
\begin{equation*}
	H(q, p)
	=
	p_i q^i
	-
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q),
\end{equation*} 
which is the crucial quantity in this setting. It represents the energy of the 
system. On finds the equations
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}
	=
	\frac{d q^i}{dt}
	\quad \text{ and } \quad
	- \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i}
	=
	\frac{d p_i}{dt}.
\end{equation*}
They remind strongly of a symplectic structure and indeed this is the case: 
using the standard sympectic matrix
\begin{equation*}
	\omega
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \Unit
		\\
		- \Unit & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
one finds
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} \vector{q^i}{p_i}
	=
	\omega
	\vector{\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i}}
	{\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}}.
\end{equation*}
More generally, one can define the Poisson bracket $\{f, g\}$ for two functions 
$\Cinfty(T^*Q)$ by
\begin{equation*}
	\{f, g\}
	=
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^3
	\left(
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}
		\frac{\partial g}{\partial p_i}
		-
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}
		\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^i}
	\right)
\end{equation*}
and finds the time evolution of a function $f$ given by
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} f
	=
	\{ f, H \}.
\end{equation*}
All of those objects have, of course, a geometrical interpretation which remain 
true for and allow generalizations from this very easy example. For a more 
complex system than one particle in a scalar potential, the configuration space 
$Q$ will be a smooth manifold, the state space $TQ$ is described by the tangent 
bundle and the phase space $T^*Q$ by the cotangent bundle. The transition from 
the Lagrange to the Hamilton formalism is done by a fiber derivative, the 
kinetic energy has a mathematical interpretation as a Riemannian metric and the 
Poisson bracket is the one which is due to the canonical symplectic form on the 
cotangent bundle. So in some sense, classical mechanics can be described by 
symplectic geometry.


The last conclusion, however, was a bit too fast. There are mechanical systems 
like the rigid body, which can not be described in the symplectic formalism, 
or which have certain symmetries and therefore allow a \emph{reduction}. A 
symmetry can mathematically be described by a Lie group $G$, which acts on 
$T^*Q$ and a reduction by a momentum map $J \colon T^*Q \longrightarrow 
\lie{g}^*$, where $\lie{g}$ is the Lie algebra of the Lie group and $\lie{g}^*$ 
its dual. The reduced phase space is a quotient of the cotangent bundle and 
does not need to be symplectic any more. Anyway, in both cases, the result will 
be something more general than a symplectic manifold: it will be a Poisson 
manifold. 
\begin{definition}[Poisson Manifold]
	A Poisson manifold is a tuple $(M, \{ \cdot, \cdot \})$ of a smooth 
	manifold $M$ and a Poisson bracket $\{ \cdot, \cdot\}$. The bracket is a 
	biderivation
	\begin{equation*}
		\{ \cdot, \cdot \}
		\colon
		\Cinfty
		\times
		\Cinfty(M)
		\longrightarrow
		\Cinfty(M),
	\end{equation*}
	which is anti-symmetric and fulfils the Jacobi identity
	\begin{equation*}
		\{ \{f, g\}, h \}
		+
		\{ \{g, h\}, f \}
		+
		\{ \{h, f\}, g \}
		=
		0.
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
A classical mechanical system will be described as a Poisson manifold together 
with a Hamilton function $H$, such that the time derivation of every function 
$f \in \Cinfty(M)$ is given by the relation
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} f(t)
	=
	\{f, H\}.
\end{equation*}
The observable algebra of this classical system is then modelled as the algebra 
of smooth functions $\Cinfty(M)$ on this Poisson manifold.



\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}
\label{subsec:chap2_Quantum}

In quantum theory, the modelling of a physical system looks completely 
different on the first sight. There is indeed no obvious way to describe how 
the transition from classical to quantum mechanics happened, but it was a hard 
and non-straightforward way which was taken in small steps of which some were 
more or less obvious and some were ingenious guesses. Built up on first ideas 
by Max Planck, who described the radiation of a black body, Albert Einstein, 
who explained the photo-electrical effect and Niels Bohr, who solved the 
problem of atomic spectra, a hand full of physicists including Max Born, 
Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\"odinger, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli and Pascual 
Jordan developed a non-intuitive and complex but extremely well working theory, 
which was able to give precise answers to very most of the open questions of 
physics at that time. However, this theory, mainly risen between 1925 and 1928, 
did not have a satisfying mathematical fundament. It took around ten more 
years, until mathematicians, mainly John von Neumann, worked out a mathematical 
theory for this and gave also a physical interpretation to their mathematical 
formulation \cite{vonneumann:1996a}. Today, quantum mechanics is usually 
introduced as a mathematical theory based on axioms and most of the textbooks 
(at least most of the more mathematical ones) use this axiomatical approach to 
explain the theory. Two very nice mathematical introductions are given by 
Bongaarts \cite{bongaarts:2015a} and Hall \cite{hall:2013a}.


The \emph{state} of a physical system is described by a vector $\psi$ on a 
Hilbert space $\hilbert H$ and the \emph{observables} are self-adjoint (and 
usually unbounded) operators on it. The spectrum of these operators describes 
the \emph{measurable values}. The theory is probabilistic with a deterministic 
time development: the pair ($A$, $\phi$) gives a probabilistic distribution, 
from which we can calculate the probability to measure $A$ with the value $a 
\in \spec (A)$ in the state $\phi$ using the spectral resolution of $A$. We 
want to illustrate this again using the example of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
moving in a potential. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a 
coordinate vector, then we have the so called Schr\"odinger representation 
given by the Hilbert space $\hilbert{H} = \Lzwei(\mathbb{R}^3)$ of square 
integrable functions with the Lebesgue measure. The state $\phi$ of a particle 
is a time-variant element of this Hilbert space which fulfils the 
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{QM:Schroedinger}
	i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi(x, t)
	=
	\hat{H}
	\psi(x, t)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}$ denotes the Hamilton operator which is given by
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}
	=
	- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m}
	\Laplace + V(x).
\end{equation}
Similar to the Hamilton function in classical mechanics, the Hamilton operator 
(or more precise: its spectrum) gives the energy of this system, $m$ is the 
mass of the particle and $V$ the potential. The operators which correspond to 
the coordinate $x_i$ and the momentum $p_j$ of the particle are given by
\begin{align*}
	\left( \hat{q}_i
	\psi \right) (x, t)
	&=
	x_i
	\psi(x, t)
	\\
	\left( \hat{p}_j
	\psi \right) (x, t)
	&=
	- i \hbar 
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
	\psi(x, t).
\end{align*}
This turns Equation \eqref{QM:Schroedinger} into
\begin{equation*}
	i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi(x, t)
	=
	\left( \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \right)
	\psi(x, t)
\end{equation*}
and makes it therefore similar to the classical time evolution.
Since the  state is a function of the coordinate $x$, one calls this the 
representation in \emph{position space}. Sometimes it is more convenient to 
describe the state in terms of its momentum and one changes to \emph{momentum 
space} via a Fourier transformation. Both representations are equivalent, very 
similar to the variables $q$ and $p$ in the Hamilton form of classical 
mechanics, from which this picture is very much inspired. Unlike the classical 
position and momentum observables being functions, the quantum mechanical 
observables are \emph{operators} and do not commute any longer. One can check 
these by calculating commutators and finds the so called Heisenberg or 
\emph{classical commutations relations}
\begin{align}
	[p_i, p_j]
	& =
	[q_i, q_j]
	=
	0
	\\
	[q_i, p_j]
	& =
	i \hbar \delta_{ij}.
\end{align}
These relations are the starting point for all quantization theories. The main 
goal is always to find an algebra which fulfils these (and maybe other) 
relations and this is what makes a quantum algebra so different from a 
classical one. Physically spoken, this noncommutativity means that a 
measurement of the position of a particle influences its momentum and vice 
versa, such that it becomes impossible to measure both, position and momentum, 
at the same time with arbitrarily high precision. This still very vague 
statement can be made precise using the Hilbert norm and the Cauchy-Schwarz 
inequality and yields the famous Heisenberg uncertainty relation
\begin{equation*}
	\Laplace a_\psi
	\Laplace b_\psi
	\geq
	\frac{1}{2}
	\left|
		\sp{\psi, [a,b] \psi}
	\right|.
\end{equation*}
Here $a,b$ are observables and $\Laplace a_\psi, \Laplace b_\psi$ denotes the 
standard deviation in the state $\psi$. For the position and momentum of a 
particle, this gives
\begin{equation*}
	\Laplace p
	\Laplace q
	\geq
	\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\end{equation*}
However, the Schr\"odinger picture is not the only possibility to describe the 
behaviour of a quantum system. Heisenberg proposed a description in which not 
the particles, but the observables are time variant. Since time evolution is 
described by a one-parameter group of unitary operators we have
\begin{equation*}
	\psi(x,t)
	=
	U(t - t_0) \psi(x, t_0),
\end{equation*}
at least in systems where the interactions are not explicitly time dependent. 
This makes it of course possible to apply unitary transformations to the states 
as well as to the operators 
\begin{equation*}
	\psi(x)
	=
	\psi(x, t_0)
	=
	U(t_0 - t) \psi(x, t)
	\quad \text{ and } \quad
	A(t)
	=
	U(t_0 - t)
	A
	U(t - t_0).
\end{equation*}
this gives the so called \emph{Heisenberg picture}, in which the 
time-dependence is not expressed ion the states but in the operators. Both 
pictures are equivalent and it is just a question of convenience which one is 
used. The unitary operators can be given more explicitly as
\begin{equation*}
	U(t - t_0)
	=
	\E^{- \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} t},
\end{equation*}
since they describe the time evolution of solutions of the Schr\"odinger 
equation. If one differentiates an operator with respect to $t$ in the 
Heisenberg picture, one finds the \emph{Heisenberg equation}
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt}
	A(t)
	=
	\frac{1}{i \hbar}
	[A(t), H].
\end{equation*}
This reminds us of course of the time evolution in terms of Poisson bracekts in 
classical mechanics., which is the second staring point for a quantization 
theories.



\section{Making Things Noncommutative: Quantization}
\label{sec:chap2_Quantization}

\subsection{The Task}
\label{subsec:chap2_Task}

We have had a brief overview over the mathematical formulation of classical and 
quantum mechanics. On one hand, if we compare the description of the state of a 
physical system (a point in the cotangent bundle of a manifold and a vector in a 
Hilbert space) we will see that they are very different. On the other hand, we 
have seen that both theories have certain things in common: the time evolution 
can be described in a similar way and we have position and momentum operators in 
the quantum theory which play a similar role to the position and momentum 
functions in the classical theory, except for their noncommutativity. Let us 
give a short list of the main concepts of both theories and compare them (a much 
more detailed list and discussion can be found in \cite{waldmann:2007a}):

	\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\egroup
This little table gives us a good hint: if one really wants to compare both 
theories, then we should understand the observable algebras as the main 
concepts rather than the states. We know that the classical theory emerges as a 
limit of many quantum system, such that the physical constant $\hbar$ becomes 
small enough to be neglected. How to construct correspondence the other way 
round is the question to which the theory of quantization addresses. Physicists 
used to solve this by "making a hat on the variables $p$ and $q$ and saying they 
the do not commute any more". Surprisingly, this approach, which is called 
\emph{canonical quantization} in physics works for most of the relevant cases, 
which is namely when we do not have high powers of $\hat p$ and $\hat q$ and not 
mixed terms. That this idea is however not canonical in a \emph{mathematical 
sense} is almost needless to say and of course it causes severe problems when 
higher and mixed terms in position and momentum appear. Those problems can be 
made precise and is known as the Groenewold-van Hove theorem 
(\cite{vanhove:1951a, groenewold:1946a}). To create a mathematical theory of 
quantization, other ways are needed and one needs to impose an ordering on the 
$\hat p$ and $\hat q$. Already Hermann Weyl knew about this problem and looked 
for ways how to solve it by proposing a symmetrization \cite{weyl:1931a} scheme 
for such terms. This ordering is now known as the Weyl ordering and his integral 
formula became the starting point for the theory of deformation quantization any 
years later.


\subsubsection{A Definition}
First, we want to take a step back and formalize, what we actually mean by a 
quantization. (See also \cite{esposito:2015a} for a good introduction to this.) 
A quantization should be a correspondence
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{Q}
	\colon
	\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}
	\longrightarrow
	\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Quantum}}
\end{equation*}
between a commutative algebra $\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$ and a 
noncommutative algebra $\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Quantum}}$, which is a 
''bijection'' in some sense: all classical observables appear as classical 
limits from quantum observables, hence we should expect $\mathcal{Q}$ to be 
''injective''. On the other hand, if the Quantum algebra was bigger than the 
classical algebra, the whole concept of quantization would be pointless, since 
we could never recover all observables and thus we want $\mathcal{Q}$ to be 
''surjective'', too. The correspondence should also keep somehow the physical 
meaning of our observables, or at least tell us, what the observable 
$\mathcal{Q}(f)$ should be for some $f \in \algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$. 
Moreover, $\mathcal{Q}^{-1}$ should behave like the classical limit, since this 
is the rather well-known direction of both. Finally, the correspondence should 
keep associative structures: the classical algebra is associative and we want 
the product in our noncommutative algebra to correspond to the concatenation of 
operators on a Hilbert space which is associative, too. One possibility of 
formulating this would be the following: in the very prototype of a classical 
observable algebra, a symplectic vector space of dimension $2n$, $n \in 
\mathbb{N}$, we want that the following three axioms are fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(Q1)]
	We want a correspondence, which allows a representation in the standard 
	picture of quantum mechanics:
	$\mathcal{Q}(1) = \Unit$, 
	$\mathcal{Q}(q^i) = \hat{q}^i$, 
	$\mathcal{Q}(p_j) = - i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial q^j}$.
	
	\item[(Q2)]
	The correspondence principle should be fulfilled:
	$[\mathcal{Q}(f), \mathcal{Q}(g)] = i \hbar \mathcal{Q}(\{f, g\}), 
	\ \forall f \in \algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$.
	
	\item[(Q3)]
	The correspondence $\mathcal{Q}$ should be linear.
\end{enumerate}
We finally split up the whole process: in a first step. we \emph{quantize} the 
system and in a second step, we look for \emph{representations} on a Hilbert 
space.

\subsubsection{Different approaches}
There exist various ideas about how to build up such a scheme. For example, in 
axiomatic quantum field theory one usually wants the quantum algebra to be a 
$C^*$-algebra (see for example \cite{haag:1993a} or 
\cite{baer.ginoux.pfaeffle:2007a}. 
The reason is that the bounded operators $\Bounded[H]$ naturally form such an 
algebra and actually even more than that. Unfortunately, most of the operators 
in quantum mechanics are unbounded. This problem is cured by looking at the 
exponentiated operators
\begin{equation*}
	A
	\longmapsto
	\E^{i t A},
	\quad t \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation*}
This way, one gets a one parameter group for $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and unitary 
operators are clearly bounded. Moreover, there is a very nice correspondence 
between $C^*$-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces, which is known as 
the Gelfand-Naimark theorem. Roughly stated, this means that there is a 
equivalence of categories between locally compact Hausdorff spaces and 
commutative $C^*$-algebras: every such space gives rise to a commutative algebra 
of complex-valued functions, which form a $C^*$-algebra. On the other hand, from 
every commutative $C^*$-algebra $\algebra{A}$ one can construct a locally 
compact Hausdorff space $X$ such that $\algebra{A} \cong \Stetig(X)$ . This 
correspondence can be extended to open and closed subsets of the space, to 
homeomorphism, the compactification of the space, vector bundles and even more. 
There is a strong link between commutative algebra and topology or geometry. One 
possibility to think of a quantized system is to think of Continuous or smooth 
functions on a noncommutative space, which then should correspond to a 
noncommutative $C^*$-algebra. This idea leads to noncommutative geometry, which 
is mostly due to Alain Connes, who developed these ideas. A very detailed, but 
not necessarily easy to read book on this idea is due to Alain Connes 
\cite{connes:1994a}, another and rather brief introduction is for example 
\cite{varilly:2006a}.


A different approach is due to geometric quantization, which tries to fulfil all 
of the three axioms (Q1) - (Q3) from the previous part. Unfortunately, this 
causes problems: Groenewold showed in \cite{groenewold:1946a}, that there can be 
no correspondence which maps the Poisson bracket directly to the quantum 
mechanical commutator, at least in the case where the observable algebra is 
$\Cinfty(M)$ for a given Poisson manifold $M$. Thus one restricts to a smaller 
algebra of observables, which is not problematic. This ideas are mostly due 
to Souriau \cite{souriau:1970a}, Kostant and Segal.


There are also different approaches. Berezin proposed a quantization for 
particular K\"ahler manifolds, for example 
\cite{berezin:1975a, berezin:1975b, berezin:1975c}. Still, new ideas keep coming 
up, but in the following, we want to concentrate on a very particular concept of 
quantization, which is called \emph{deformation quantization}.



\section{Deformation Quantization}
\label{sec:chap2_DQ}

\subsection{The Concept}
\label{subsec:chap2_Concept}

Deformation quantization tries to realize the three points (Q1) - (Q3) from the 
previous section, but weakens the third. If it is not possible to have such a 
correspondence in an exact way, we will at least want to have it 
\emph{asymptotically}. The motivating example is the Weyl quantization which we 
already talked of. There are actually two such formulas, which can be given: the 
first maps a function $f$ in the variables $q, p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to a 
differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is actually a formal power series 
in the parameter $\hbar$. For polynomial functions, this is series is a sum and 
well defined, for general function this will really be a formal power series. 
The second is given by an integral formula and also holds for another class of 
functions (Schwartz functions), but one gets the first formula out of the second 
as an asymptotic expansion for $\hbar \longrightarrow 0$. With these 
quantizations, one can also define a product of two functions $f, g$, which will 
necessarily take those two functions to a formal power series in $\hbar$. Moyal 
showed that the commutator of this product can be understood as the quantum 
mechanical commutator \cite{moyal:1949a}. The reason, why all of a sudden power 
series appear, is the following: if one wants the correspondence principle to be 
fulfilled and the multiplication of these quantized functions to be associative 
(as needed for representations on the Hilbert space), one will necessarily get 
higher and higher orders in $\hbar$ and one can never stop without loosing 
associativity. Motivated by this observation, a group of mathematicians (mostly 
from Dijon) started working out this idea of products as formal power series. 
They understood quantization as a \emph{deformation} of the commutative product 
by a formal parameter (mostly called $\hbar$, in this work we will call it $z$ 
from now on), which controls the noncommutativity of the theory and which 
fulfils some compatibility condition with the classical theory. This was the 
hour of birth of deformation quantization. The main characters of this group 
were Flato, Lichnerowicz, Bayen, Fr{\o}nsdal and Sternheimer, who published 
their ideas in the late 70's \cite{bayen.et.al:1977a, bayen.et.al:1978a} and 
gave the definition of a star product.
\begin{definition}[Star Product]
	\label{Def:StarProduct}
	Let $(M, \{\cdot, \cdot\})$ be a Poisson manifold over a field 
	$\mathbb{K}$ with $\mathbb{K}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ or  $\mathbb{C}$.
	A star product on $M$ is a bilinear map
	\begin{equation*}
	    \star_z \colon 
    	\Cinfty(M) 
    	\times 
	    \Cinfty(M) 
	    \longrightarrow
	    \Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket
	    , \
	    (f,g) 
	    \longmapsto 
	    f \star_z g 
	    =
	    \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty 
	    z^n C_n(f,g)
	\end{equation*}
	such that its $\mathbb{K}\llbracket z \rrbracket$-linear extension to 
	$\Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket$ fulfils the following properties:
	\begin{definitionlist}
		\item
		$\star_z$ is associative.
		
		\item
		$C_0(f, g) = f g,\ \forall_{f,g \in \Cinfty(M)}$ (Classical limit).
		
		\item
		$C_1(f, g) - C_1(g, f)= z \{f, g\},\ \forall_{f,g \in \Cinfty(M)}$
		(Semi-classical limit).
		
		\item
		$1 \star_z f = f \star_z 1 = f,\ \forall_{f \in \Cinfty(M)}$.
	\end{definitionlist}
	If the $C_n$ are bidifferential operators, the star product is said to be 
	differential and if the order of differentiation of the $C_n$ does not 
	exceed $n$ in both arguments, a differential star product is said to be 
	natural.
\end{definition}
They also defined a notion of equivalence of star products. The idea behind is 
that two equivalent star products should give rise to the same physics, in some 
way.
\begin{definition}[Equivalence of Star Products]
	Two star products $\star_z$ and $\widehat{\star}_z$ for a Poisson manifold 
	$(M, \{\cdot, \cdot\})$ are said to be equivalent, if there is a formal 
	power series
	\begin{equation*}
		T
		=
		\id +
		\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}
		z^n T_n
	\end{equation*}
	of linear maps $T_n \colon \Cinfty(M) \longrightarrow \Cinfty(M)$, which 
	extends linearly to $\Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket$, such that the 
	following things hold:
	\begin{equation*}
		f \widehat{\star}_z g
		=
		T^{-1}
		\left(
			T(f) \star_z T(g)
		\right)
		, \ 
		\forall_{f,g \in Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket}
		\quad \text{ and } \quad
		T(1) 
		= 
		1.
	\end{equation*}
	For differential or natural star products, we also speak of differential or 
	natural equivalence transformations.
\end{definition}
Note that these definitions are purely algebraic, since we nowhere ask for the 
convergence of those power series. Hence the theory which was developed from 
this in the following years is also a mostly algebraic theory. There were still 
the integral formulas around for which one can also make sense of convergence, 
but as already said, one has to restrict the class of functions, which one can 
multiply drastically, for example to the Schwartz space. However, these two 
articles were the starting point for what has now become a rich and fruitful 
theory.



\subsection{A Mathematical Theory}
\label{subsec:chap2_MathTheory}
Deformation quantization is a good example for a mathematical theory, which is 
motivated by a physical idea. It is not really talking about a physical problem, 
since the world does not need to be quantized -- it already is. It is talking 
about a mathematical problem: how to recover the quantized (and very counter-
intuitive) mathematics, which describe the world out of the classical (and much 
more intuitive) mathematics, which describe the world on our scale? Deformation 
quantization tries to give an answer to that, but unfortunately is (at its 
present state) still far from doing so completely. Like many such theories, it 
started of from a more or less precise physical background and developed into 
something quite different: a mostly algebraic, purely mathematical theory. That 
is also a bit due to the fact that the questions, which had to be answered in 
the beginning, were very hard and took a lot of time. Meanwhile, mathematicians 
were interested in the purely mathematical aspect of the theory and started 
working on that. We want to give a short overview over those questions and their 
answers very briefly and point out a little the history of this theory.


The prototype is, as already mentioned, a symplectic vector space, for which 
Weyl proposed a star product with a certain (symmetric) ordering (although the 
definition of a star product did not exist at his time). However, other 
orderings are possible: one can have a standard or an anti-standard ordering, 
where the $p$'s are all put to the right or to the left, respectively, or 
something in  between. One of the first questions was, if one can also construct 
star products on symplectic manifolds and if these products will be standard or 
Weyl ordered, if they will be differential or natural and so on. Locally, the 
answer was yes, but it took some time and many small steps, until DeWilde and 
Lecomte could show that every cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold has star 
products \cite{dewilde.lecomte:1983a} and then extended this result to arbitrary 
smooth manifolds \cite{dewilde.lecomte:1983b}. Another proof was given 
indepently from that by Omori, Maeda and Yoshioka 
\cite{omori.maeda.yoshioka:1991a} and then by Fedosov, who presented a simple 
and very geometric construction \cite{fedosov:1994a}, which always gives even 
natural ordered star products, as shown in \cite{bordemann.waldmann:1997a} 
or more generally in \cite{gutt.rawnsley:2003a}. Moreover, every star product an a 
symplectic manifold is equivalent to a edosov star product 
\cite{beretlson.cahen.gutt:1997a} A lot of 
results were found for K\"ahler manifolds and also the already mentioned 
procedure, which is due to Berezin, gives rise to star products. There are 
moreover standard, anti-standard ordered and many other types of star products 
on every cotangent bundle. The next question was the one concerning the 
equivalence classes of star products in the symplectic case. One can show that 
locally, two star products on a symplectic manifold are always equivalent. Hence 
a classification result should depend on global phenomena. Indeed, this is the 
case and it can be shown that star products on a symplectic manifold are 
classified by the second deRham cohomology $\HdR^2(M)$ of a manifold. This 
result is due to Deligne \cite{deligne:1995a}, a different proof was given by 
Nest and Tsygan \cite{nest.tsygan:1995a, nest.tsygan:1995a}, another by 
Bertelson, Cahen and Gutt \cite{bertelson.cahen.gutt:1997a}. More exactly: the 
choice of an equivalence class of closed 2-forms $\omega \in \Formen^2(M)$ 
determines a Fedosov star product (hence a natural one) and from every Fedosov 
star product one can calculate such an equivalence class. This already 
determines all star products on symplectic manifolds, since every star product 
on such a manifold is equivalent to a Fedosov star product. The case of Poisson 
manifolds took longer and was much harder to solve, since associativity turned 
out to be a complicated property to fulfil. There were some examples of star 
products known for particular Poisson structure, like the Gutt star product 
\cite{gutt:1983a}, which was also found by Drinfel'd \cite{drinfeld:1983a} 
idependently, but the general existence (and also the classification) result was 
proven by Kontsevich \cite{kontsevich:1997:pre, kontsevich:2003a} many years 
later. his classification result is known as the formality theorem and needs the 
notion of $L_{\infty}$-algebras, which are fairly involved objects. He gave a 
construction, how star products can be constructed out of Poisson brackets on 
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This construction was extended by Cattaneo, Felder and Tomassini 
to Poisson manifolds \cite{cattaneo.felder.tomassini:2002b} and also by 
Dolgushev \cite{dolgushev:2005a}. Another and easier formulation of the 
Kontsevich construction on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in terms of operads was then given by 
Tamrakin \cite{tamarkin:2003a}.



\subsection{From Formal to Strict}
\label{subsec:chap2_Formal2Strict}

So far, one could say that the big cornerstones of the theory are already there 
and that it is somehow ''finished''. For two reasons, this is not the case. 
First, a mathematical theory is actually never ''finished'', since there is 
always a lot new things which can be found. There are still a lot of different 
types of star products to classify, like invariant or equivariant star products 
in the case that one has Lie group or Lie algebra actions. A very recent result 
concerning the classification of equivariant star products on symplectic 
manifolds is, for example, due to Reichert and Waldmann 
\cite{reichert.waldmann:2015a:pre}. Second, the theory of deformation 
quantization still has a different aspect: all we talked about so far was purely 
algebraic and there is no notions of convergence of these formal power series. 
If some day, this theory shall have a real drawback on physics, it will be 
necessary to talk about the convergence properties of these star products, since 
in physics $\hbar$ is \emph{not} a formal parameter but a constant with a 
dimension and a fixed value and therefore the question of convergence matters. 
When we talk about continuous star products, we leave the field of \emph{formal} 
deformation quantization and come to \emph{strict} deformation quantization.


Although it is closer to physics, strict deformation quantization is still an 
entirely mathematical theory. There are two different approaches to it: we 
already mentioned the integral formulas, which allow to speak of continuous star 
products. The second approach uses the formal power series instead and wants to 
construct a topology on the polynomial algebra, such that the star product is 
continuous and then extend by the completion of the vector space to a subalgebra 
of the smooth functions, on which the star product will still be continuous.


The first approach is mostly due to Rieffel, who developed this ideas in some of 
his papers \cite{rieffel:1989a, rieffel:1990c, rieffel:1993a}. He wants to 
realize a strict deformation quantization by actions of a Lie group on a 
$C^*$-algebra of classical observables. The idea behind is that in physics, one 
often wants the observable algebra to be a $C^*$-algebra. One can realize the 
this algebra (by exponentiating) as a subalgebra of $\Bounded{H}$ which has the 
$C^*$-property. Later Rieffel formulated a list of open questions, which strict 
deformation quantization should try to answer \cite{rieffel:1998a}. His approach 
was carried on by Bieliavsky and Gayral 
\cite{bieliavsky:2002a, bieliavsky.gayral:2015a}, who 
extended these ideas to more general Lie groups and different manifolds. To get 
reasonably big observable algebras, they used oscillatory integrals and pushed 
this theory strongly forward. A similar idea was realized by Natsume, Nest and 
Peter \cite{natsume.nest.peter:2003a}, who could show that under certain 
topological conditions, symplectic manifolds admit strict deformations.


The second approach is due to Beiser and Waldmann 
\cite{beiser:2011a, beiser.waldmann:2014a}. They restrict to the 
local situation, that means to Poisson structures on vector space. Then, they 
look at the polynomial functions on this vector spaces and try to find 
continuity estimates for them, by constructing and explicit locally convex 
topology on the symmetric tensor algebra which is isomorphic to the polynomial 
algebra. The aim is to make the topology as coarse as possible, to get then a 
large completion of the polynomial algebra and hence a big quantized algebra of 
observables. There are two big advantages of this approach: the first one is 
that it can be applied to infinite dimensional vector spaces, which is necessary 
for quantum field theory, which deals with infinitely many degrees of freedom. 
The second one is, that we can really speak about all observables, also those 
which will correspond to unbounded operators, without having to exponentiate. In 
this sense, this idea is somehow more fundamental. The disadvantage is, however, 
that it is just a local theory at the moment. The idea is worked out just for 
one type of star products by now, which are star products of exponential type, 
which means star products on symplectic vector spaces which come from a constant 
Poisson tensor \cite{waldmann:2014a}. This theory was carried on in the master 
thesis of Matthias Sch\"otz \cite{schoetz:2014a}, who rephrased it using 
semi-inner product, which are a somehow more physical notion, since one can 
interpret spaces with such a topology as projective limit of Hilbert spaces.
This also allows a slightly coarser topology and hence a larger completion of the 
symmetric tensor algebra.


In this work, we will follow this approach and apply it to 
another type of star product, the Gutt star product, which comes from linear 
Poisson tensors on a vector space. This is somehow the next logical step after 
constant Poisson tensors. However, these are also the first \emph{Poisson} (so 
non-symplectic) structures, which will be strictly quantized this way. Thus this 
master thesis really contributes something new to the theory of strict 
deformation quantization: a second example, in which Waldmann's locally convex 
topology on the tensor algebra leads to a continuous star product, when 
considered as a power series and not as an integral. Remind that this also has a 
certain effect on Lie theory: the result can be seen as a functorial 
construction for a locally convex topology on the universal enveloping algebra 
$\algebra{U}(\lie{g})$ of a (possibly infitely-dimensional) Lie algebra 
$\lie{g}$ and can therefore have applications to, for example, the 
representation theory of $\algebra{U}(\lie{g})$.
