\chapter{Deformation quantization}

The starting point for every theory of quantization is surely mechanics. Here, 
mechanics means both, the classical and the quantum theory. Since we want to 
explain how one can link them together, we will give a short overview of both 
theories and show their similarities and their differences in the first section 
of this chapter. Then we will come to different aspects of quantization and 
state the most important ideas in the next part. In section three, we will 
focus on Deformation quantization and give an overview of this rather young 
theory.



\section{Mechanics: The Classical and the Quantum World}
\label{sec:chap2_Mechanics}

\subsection{Classical Mechanical Systems}
\label{subsec:chap2_Classical}
We want to recall briefly the notions of classical mechanics. There are many 
good books on this subject and also the notation is mostly uniform everywhere, 
but nevertheless want to refer to the books of Marsden and Ratiu 
\cite{marsden.ratiu:1999a} and Arnold \cite{arnold:1989a}, which give very good 
introductions and overviews of the whole theory.
Imagine the simplest model for a mechanical system, which is not trivial: a 
single particle with mass $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in a scalar potential $V$. We 
will denote his position by $q = (q^1, q^2, q^3) \in Q = \mathbb{R}^3$ and call 
the set of all possible positions $Q$ the configuration space. Since we also 
have a time coordinate $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we can describe the path on which 
the particle moves by $q(t)$. The state of the particle is completely described 
by its position and its velocity $(q(t), \dot q(t))$ and the velocity should be 
understood as a tangent vector $\dot q(t) \in T_{q(t)}Q = \mathbb{R}^3$. 
Therefore, the tangent bundle $TQ$, which is in this case $\mathbb{R}^6$, is 
sometimes called the state space. In classical mechanics, we can describe the 
movement of the particle with the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are derived 
from the Lagrange function by a variational principle. The Lagrange function of 
this system reads
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q)
	=
	T(q, \dot q) - V(q, \dot q)
\end{equation*}
and $T(q, \dot q) = \frac{1}{2} m  \sum_{i=1}^3 \dot{q^i}^2$ is the kinetic 
energy. The action 
is defined as the integral
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{S}(q, \dot q)
	=
	\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q)
	dt.
\end{equation*}
It is a physical observation, similar to a mathematical axiom, that this action 
functional is minimized along the trajectories of the particle. So fixing a 
starting point $q_0$ and an end point $q_1$ of a trajectory, we find
\begin{equation*}
	\delta \mathcal{S}
	\at{q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1}
	=
	0.
\end{equation*}
From this, one finds the Euler-Lagrange equations for $i = 1, 2, 3$
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} 
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot q^i}
	-
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i}
	=
	0.
\end{equation*}
In our case this means
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} 
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot q^i}
	-
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial q^i}
	=
	m \ddot q
	-
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial q^i}
	=
	0
\end{equation*}
and we can integrate the equations to get the trajectory. So far, we described 
the system in the state space and for obvious reasons, this formalism is called 
the Lagrange formalism. It is not the only formalism, which describes to 
behaviour of the system: one can go to the so called Hamilton formalism, which 
is based on the conjugate momenta $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3) \in T_{q(t)}^*Q$
\begin{equation*}
	p_i(t)
	=
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot q^i}
\end{equation*}
and linked to the Lagrange formalism by a Legendre transformation. Now we can 
define the Hamilton function
\begin{equation*}
	H(q, p)
	=
	p_i q^i
	-
	\mathcal{L}(q, \dot q),
\end{equation*} 
which is the crucial quantity in this setting. It represents the energy of the 
system. On finds the equations
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}
	=
	\frac{d q^i}{dt}
	\quad \text{ and } \quad
	- \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i}
	=
	\frac{d p_i}{dt}.
\end{equation*}
They remind strongly of a symplectic structure and indeed this is the case: 
using the standard sympectic matrix
\begin{equation*}
	\omega
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \Unit
		\\
		- \Unit & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
one finds
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} \vector{q^i}{p_i}
	=
	\omega
	\vector{\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i}}
	{\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}}.
\end{equation*}
More generally, one can define the Poisson bracket $\{f, g\}$ for two functions 
$\Cinfty(T^*Q)$ by
\begin{equation*}
	\{f, g\}
	=
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^3
	\left(
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}
		\frac{\partial g}{\partial p_i}
		-
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}
		\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^i}
	\right)
\end{equation*}
and finds the time evolution of a function $f$ given by
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} f
	=
	\{ f, H \}.
\end{equation*}
All of those objects have, of course, a geometrical interpretation which remain 
true for and allow generalizations from this very easy example. For a more 
complex system than one particle in a scalar potential, the configuration space 
$Q$ will be a smooth manifold, the state space $TQ$ is described by the tangent 
bundle and the phase space $T^*Q$ by the cotangent bundle. The transition from 
the Lagrange to the Hamilton formalism is done by a fiber derivative, the 
kinetic energy has a mathematical interpretation as a Riemannian metric and the 
Poisson bracket is the one which is due to the canonical symplectic form on the 
cotangent bundle. So in some sense, classical mechanics can be described by 
symplectic geometry.


The last conclusion, however, was a bit too fast. There are mechanical systems 
like the rigid body, which can not be described in the symplectic formalism, 
or which have certain symmetries and therefore allow a \emph{reduction}. A 
symmetry can mathematically be described by a Lie group $G$, which acts on 
$T^*Q$ and a reduction by a momentum map $J \colon T^*Q \longrightarrow 
\lie{g}^*$, where $\lie{g}$ is the Lie algebra of the Lie group and $\lie{g}^*$ 
its dual. The reduced phase space is a quotient of the cotangent bundle and 
does not need to be symplectic any more. Anyway, in both cases, the result will 
be something more general than a symplectic manifold: it will be a Poisson 
manifold. 
\begin{definition}[Poisson Manifold]
	A Poisson manifold is a tuple $(M, \{ \cdot, \cdot \})$ of a smooth 
	manifold $M$ and a Poisson bracket $\{ \cdot, \cdot\}$. The bracket is a 
	biderivation
	\begin{equation*}
		\{ \cdot, \cdot \}
		\colon
		\Cinfty
		\times
		\Cinfty(M)
		\longrightarrow
		\Cinfty(M),
	\end{equation*}
	which is anti-symmetric and fulfils the Jacobi identity
	\begin{equation*}
		\{ \{f, g\}, h \}
		+
		\{ \{g, h\}, f \}
		+
		\{ \{h, f\}, g \}
		=
		0.
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
A classical mechanical system will be described as a Poisson manifold together 
with a Hamilton function $H$, such that the time derivation of every function 
$f \in \Cinfty(M)$ is given by the relation
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt} f(t)
	=
	\{f, H\}.
\end{equation*}
The observable algebra of this classical system is then modelled as the algebra 
of smooth functions $\Cinfty(M)$ on this Poisson manifold.



\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}
\label{subsec:chap2_Quantum}

In quantum theory, the modelling of a physical system looks completely 
different on the first sight. There is indeed no obvious way to describe how 
the transition from classical to quantum mechanics happened, but it was a hard 
and non-straightforward way which was taken in small steps of which some were 
more or less obvious and some were ingenious guesses. Built up on first ideas 
by Max Planck, who described the radiation of a black body, Albert Einstein, 
who explained the photo-electrical effect and Niels Bohr, who solved the 
problem of atomic spectra, a hand full of physicists including Max Born, 
Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\"odinger, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli and Pascual 
Jordan developed a non-intuitive and complex but extremely well working theory, 
which was able to give precise answers to very most of the open questions of 
physics at that time. However, this theory, mainly risen between 1925 and 1928, 
did not have a satisfying mathematical fundament. It took around ten more 
years, until mathematicians, mainly John von Neumann, worked out a mathematical 
theory for this and gave also a physical interpretation to their mathematical 
formulation \cite{vonneumann:1996a}. Today, quantum mechanics is usually 
introduced as a mathematical theory based on axioms and most of the textbooks 
(at least most of the more mathematical ones) use this axiomatical approach to 
explain the theory. Two very nice mathematical introductions are given by 
Bongaarts \cite{bongaarts:2015a} and Hall \cite{hall:2013a}.


The \emph{state} of a physical system is described by a vector $\psi$ on a 
Hilbert space $\hilbert H$ and the \emph{observables} are self-adjoint (and 
usually unbounded) operators on it. The spectrum of these operators describes 
the \emph{measurable values}. The theory is probabilistic with a deterministic 
time development: the pair ($A$, $\phi$) gives a probabilistic distribution, 
from which we can calculate the probability to measure $A$ with the value $a 
\in \spec (A)$ in the state $\phi$ using the spectral resolution of $A$. We 
want to illustrate this again using the example of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
moving in a potential. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a 
coordinate vector, then we have the so called Schr\"odinger representation 
given by the Hilbert space $\hilbert{H} = \Lzwei(\mathbb{R}^3)$ of square 
integrable functions with the Lebesgue measure. The state $\phi$ of a particle 
is a time-variant element of this Hilbert space which fulfils the 
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{QM:Schroedinger}
	i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi(x, t)
	=
	\hat{H}
	\psi(x, t)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}$ denotes the Hamilton operator which is given by
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}
	=
	- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m}
	\Laplace + V(x).
\end{equation}
Similar to the Hamilton function in classical mechanics, the Hamilton operator 
(or more precise: its spectrum) gives the energy of this system, $m$ is the 
mass of the particle and $V$ the potential. The operators which correspond to 
the coordinate $x_i$ and the momentum $p_j$ of the particle are given by
\begin{align*}
	\left( \hat{q}_i
	\psi \right) (x, t)
	&=
	x_i
	\psi(x, t)
	\\
	\left( \hat{p}_j
	\psi \right) (x, t)
	&=
	- i \hbar 
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
	\psi(x, t).
\end{align*}
This turns Equation \eqref{QM:Schroedinger} into
\begin{equation*}
	i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi(x, t)
	=
	\left( \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \right)
	\psi(x, t)
\end{equation*}
and makes it therefore similar to the classical time evolution.
Since the  state is a function of the coordinate $x$, one calls this the 
representation in \emph{position space}. Sometimes it is more convenient to 
describe the state in terms of its momentum and one changes to \emph{momentum 
space} via a Fourier transformation. Both representations are equivalent, very 
similar to the variables $q$ and $p$ in the Hamilton form of classical 
mechanics, from which this picture is very much inspired. Unlike the classical 
position and momentum observables being functions, the quantum mechanical 
observables are \emph{operators} and do not commute any longer. One can check 
these by calculating commutators and finds the so called Heisenberg or 
\emph{classical commutations relations}
\begin{align}
	[p_i, p_j]
	& =
	[q_i, q_j]
	=
	0
	\\
	[q_i, p_j]
	& =
	i \hbar \delta_{ij}.
\end{align}
These relations are the starting point for all quantization theories. The main 
goal is always to find an algebra which fulfils these (and maybe other) 
relations and this is what makes a quantum algebra so different from a 
classical one. Physically spoken, this noncommutativity means that a 
measurement of the position of a particle influences its momentum and vice 
versa, such that it becomes impossible to measure both, position and momentum, 
at the same time with arbitrarily high precision. This still very vague 
statement can be made precise using the Hilbert norm and the Cauchy-Schwarz 
inequality and yields the famous Heisenberg uncertainty relation
\begin{equation*}
	\Laplace a_\psi
	\Laplace b_\psi
	\geq
	\frac{1}{2}
	\left|
		\sp{\psi, [a,b] \psi}
	\right|.
\end{equation*}
Here $a,b$ are observables and $\Laplace a_\psi, \Laplace b_\psi$ denotes the 
standard deviation in the state $\psi$. For the position and momentum of a 
particle, this gives
\begin{equation*}
	\Laplace p
	\Laplace q
	\geq
	\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\end{equation*}
However, the Schr\"odinger picture is not the only possibility to describe the 
behaviour of a quantum system. Heisenberg proposed a description in which not 
the particles, but the observables are time variant. Since time evolution is 
described by a one-parameter group of unitary operators we have
\begin{equation*}
	\psi(x,t)
	=
	U(t - t_0) \psi(x, t_0),
\end{equation*}
at least in systems where the interactions are not explicitly time dependent. 
This makes it of course possible to apply unitary transformations to the states 
as well as to the operators 
\begin{equation*}
	\psi(x)
	=
	\psi(x, t_0)
	=
	U(t_0 - t) \psi(x, t)
	\quad \text{ and } \quad
	A(t)
	=
	U(t_0 - t)
	A
	U(t - t_0).
\end{equation*}
this gives the so called \emph{Heisenberg picture}, in which the 
time-dependence is not expressed ion the states but in the operators. Both 
pictures are equivalent and it is just a question of convenience which one is 
used. The unitary operators can be given more explicitly as
\begin{equation*}
	U(t - t_0)
	=
	\E^{- \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} t},
\end{equation*}
since they describe the time evolution of solutions of the Schr\"odinger 
equation. If one differentiates an operator with respect to $t$ in the 
Heisenberg picture, one finds the \emph{Heisenberg equation}
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d}{dt}
	A(t)
	=
	\frac{1}{i \hbar}
	[A(t), H].
\end{equation*}
This reminds us of course of the time evolution in terms of Poisson bracekts in 
classical mechanics., which is the second staring point for a quantization 
theories.



\section{Making Things Noncommutative: Quantization}
\label{sec:chap2_Quantization}

\subsection{The Task}
\label{subsec:chap2_Task}

We have had a brief overview over the mathematical formulation of classical and 
quantum mechanics. On one hand, if we compare the description of the state of a 
physical system (a point in the cotangent bundle of a manifold and a vector in a 
Hilbert space) we will see that they are very different. On the other hand, we 
have seen that both theories have certain things in common: the time evolution 
can be described in a similar way and we have position and momentum operators in 
the quantum theory which play a similar role to the position and momentum 
functions in the classical theory, except for their noncommutativity. Let us 
give a short list of the main concepts of both theories and compare them (a much 
more detailed list and discussion can be found in \cite{waldmann:2007a}):

	\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\egroup
This little table gives us a good hint: if one really wants to compare both 
theories, then we should understand the observable algebras as the main 
concepts rather than the states. We know that the classical theory emerges as a 
limit of many quantum system, such that the physical constant $\hbar$ becomes 
small enough to be neglected. How to construct correspondence the other way 
round is the question to which the theory of quantization addresses. Physicists 
used to solve this by "making a hat on the variables $p$ and $q$ and saying they 
the do not commute any more". Surprisingly, this approach, which is called 
\emph{canonical quantization} in physics works for most of the relevant cases, 
which is namely when we do not have high powers of $\hat p$ and $\hat q$ and not 
mixed terms. That this idea is however not canonical in a \emph{mathematical 
sense} is almost needless to say and of course it causes severe problems when 
higher and mixed terms in position and momentum appear. Those problems can be 
made precise and is known as the Groenewold-van Hove theorem 
(\cite{vanhove:1951a, groenewold:1946a}). To create a mathematical theory of 
quantization, other ways are needed and one needs to impose an ordering on the 
$\hat p$ and $\hat q$. Already Hermann Weyl knew about this problem and looked 
for ways how to solve it by proposing a symmetrization \cite{weyl:1931a} scheme 
for such terms. This ordering is now known as the Weyl ordering and his integral 
formula became the starting point for the theory of deformation quantization any 
years later.


\subsubsection{A Definition}
First, we want to take a step back and formalize, what we actually mean by a 
quantization. (See also \cite{esposito:2015a} for a good introduction to this.) 
A quantization should be a correspondence
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{Q}
	\colon
	\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}
	\longrightarrow
	\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Quantum}}
\end{equation*}
between a commutative algebra $\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$ and a 
noncommutative algebra $\algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Quantum}}$, which is a 
''bijection'' in some sense: all classical observables appear as classical 
limits from quantum observables, hence we should expect $\mathcal{Q}$ to be 
''injective''. On the other hand, if the Quantum algebra was bigger than the 
classical algebra, the whole concept of quantization would be pointless, since 
we could never recover all observables and thus we want $\mathcal{Q}$ to be 
''surjective'', too. The correspondence should also keep somehow the physical 
meaning of our observables, or at least tell us, what the observable 
$\mathcal{Q}(f)$ should be for some $f \in \algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$. 
Moreover, $\mathcal{Q}^{-1}$ should behave like the classical limit, since this 
is the rather well-known direction of both. Finally, the correspondence should 
keep associative structures: the classical algebra is associative and we want 
the product in our noncommutative algebra to correspond to the concatenation of 
operators on a Hilbert space which is associative, too. One possibility of 
formulating this would be the following: in the very prototype of a classical 
observable algebra, a symplectic vector space of dimension $2n$, $n \in 
\mathbb{N}$, we want that the following three axioms are fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(Q1)]
	We want a correspondence, which allows a representation in the standard 
	picture of quantum mechanics:
	$\mathcal{Q}(1) = \Unit$, 
	$\mathcal{Q}(q^i) = \hat{q}^i$, 
	$\mathcal{Q}(p_j) = - i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial q^j}$.
	
	\item[(Q2)]
	The correspondence principle should be fulfilled:
	$[\mathcal{Q}(f), \mathcal{Q}(g)] = i \hbar \mathcal{Q}(\{f, g\}), 
	\ \forall f \in \algebra{A}_{\mathrm{Classical}}$.
	
	\item[(Q3)]
	The correspondence $\mathcal{Q}$ should be linear.
\end{enumerate}
We finally split up the whole process: in a first step. we \emph{quantize} the 
system and in a second step, we look for \emph{representations} on a Hilbert 
space.

\subsubsection{Different approaches}
There exist various ideas about how to build up such a scheme. For example, in 
axiomatic quantum field theory one usually wants the quantum algebra to be a 
$C^*$-algebra (see for example \cite{haag:1993a} or 
\cite{baer.ginoux.pfaeffle:2007a}. 
The reason is that the bounded operators $\Bounded[H]$ naturally form such an 
algebra and actually even more than that. Unfortunately, most of the operators 
in quantum mechanics are unbounded. This problem is cured by looking at the 
exponentiated operators
\begin{equation*}
	A
	\longmapsto
	\E^{i t A},
	\quad t \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation*}
This way, one gets a one parameter group for $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and unitary 
operators are clearly bounded. Moreover, there is a very nice correspondence 
between $C^*$-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces, which is known as 
the Gelfand-Naimark theorem. Roughly stated, this means that there is a 
equivalence of categories between locally compact Hausdorff spaces and 
commutative $C^*$-algebras: every such space gives rise to a commutative algebra 
of complex-valued functions, which form a $C^*$-algebra. On the other hand, from 
every commutative $C^*$-algebra $\algebra{A}$ one can construct a locally 
compact Hausdorff space $X$ such that $\algebra{A} \cong \Stetig(X)$ . This 
correspondence can be extended to open and closed subsets of the space, to 
homeomorphism, the compactification of the space, vector bundles and even more. 
There is a strong link between commutative algebra and topology or geometry. One 
possibility to think of a quantized system is to think of Continuous or smooth 
functions on a noncommutative space, which then should correspond to a 
noncommutative $C^*$-algebra. This idea leads to noncommutative geometry, which 
is mostly due to Alain Connes, who developed these ideas. A very detailed, but 
not necessarily easy to read book on this idea is due to Alain Connes 
\cite{connes:1994a}, another and rather brief introduction is for example 
\cite{varilly:2006a}.


A different approach is due to geometric quantization, which tries to fulfil all 
of the three axioms (Q1) - (Q3) from the previous part. Unfortunately, this 
causes problems: Groenewold showed in \cite{groenewold:1946a}, that there can be 
no correspondence which maps the Poisson bracket directly to the quantum 
mechanical commutator, at least in the case where the observable algebra is 
$\Cinfty(M)$ for a given Poisson manifold $M$. Thus one restricts to a smaller 
algebra of observables, which is not problematic. This ideas are mostly due 
to Souriau \cite{souriau:1970a}, Kostant and Segal.


There are also different approaches. Berezin proposed a quantization for 
particular K\"ahler manifolds, for example 
\cite{berezin:1975a, berezin:1975b, berezin:1975c}. Still, new ideas keep coming 
up, but in the following, we want to concentrate on a very particular concept of 
quantization, which is called \emph{deformation quantization}.



\section{Deformation Quantization}
\label{sec:chap2_DQ}

\subsection{The Concept}
\label{subsec:chap2_Concept}

Deformation quantization tries to realize the three points (Q1) - (Q3) from the 
previous section, but weakens the third. If it is not possible to have such a 
correspondence in an exact way, we will at least want to have it 
\emph{asymptotically}. The motivating example is the Weyl quantization which we 
already talked of. There are actually two such formulas, which can be given: the 
first maps a function $f$ in the variables $q, p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to a 
differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is actually a formal power series 
in the parameter $\hbar$. For polynomial functions, this is series is a sum and 
well defined, for general function this will really be a formal power series. 
The second is given by an integral formula and also holds for another class of 
functions (Schwartz functions), but one gets the first formula out of the second 
as an asymptotic expansion for $\hbar \longrightarrow 0$. With these 
quantizations, one can also define a product of two functions $f, g$, which will 
necessarily take those two functions to a formal power series in $\hbar$. Moyal 
showed that the commutator of this product can be understood as the quantum 
mechanical commutator \cite{moyal:1949a}. The reason, why all of a sudden power 
series appear, is the following: if one wants the correspondence principle to be 
fulfilled and the multiplication of these quantized functions to be associative 
(as needed for representations on the Hilbert space), one will necessarily get 
higher and higher orders in $\hbar$ and one can never stop without loosing 
associativity. Motivated by this observation, a group of mathematicians (mostly 
from Dijon) started working out this idea of products as formal power series. 
They understood quantization as a \emph{deformation} of the commutative product 
by a formal parameter (mostly called $\hbar$, in this work we will call it $z$ 
from now on), which controls the noncommutativity of the theory and which 
fulfils some compatibility condition with the classical theory. This was the 
hour of birth of deformation quantization. The main characters of this group 
were Flato, Lichnerowicz, Bayen, Fr{\o}nsdal and Sternheimer, who published 
their ideas in the late 70's \cite{bayen.et.al:1977a, bayen.et.al:1978a} and 
gave the definition of a star product.
\begin{definition}[Star Product]
	\label{Def:StarProduct}
	Let $(M, \{\cdot, \cdot\})$ be a Poisson manifold over a field 
	$\mathbb{K}$ with $\mathbb{K}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ or  $\mathbb{C}$.
	A star product on $M$ is a bilinear map
	\begin{equation*}
	    \star_z \colon 
    	\Cinfty(M) 
    	\times 
	    \Cinfty(M) 
	    \longrightarrow
	    \Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket
	    , \
	    (f,g) 
	    \longmapsto 
	    f \star_z g 
	    =
	    \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty 
	    z^n C_n(f,g)
	\end{equation*}
	such that its $\mathbb{K}\llbracket z \rrbracket$-linear extension to 
	$\Cinfty(M) \llbracket z \rrbracket$ fulfils the following properties:
	\begin{definitionlist}
		\item
		$\star_z$ is associative.
		
		\item
		$C_0(f, g) = f g,\ \forall_{f,g \in \Cinfty(M)}$ (Classical limit).
		
		\item
		$C_1(f, g) - C_1(g, f)= z \{f, g\},\ \forall_{f,g \in \Cinfty(M)}$
		(Semi-classical limit).
		
		\item
		$1 \star_z f = f \star_z 1 = f,\ \forall_{f \in \Cinfty(M)}$
	\end{definitionlist}
	is an associative product on
	$\Cinfty(M)\llbracket z \rrbracket$, all $C_n$ are bidifferential 
	operators and $C_0(f,g) = fg$ and $C_1(f,g) - C_1(g,f) = z \{f, g\}$ 
	holds for all $f,g \in \Cinfty(M)$.
\end{definition}
Note that this definition is purely algebraic, since we nowhere ask for the 
convergence of this power series. Hence the theory which developed from this in 
the following years is also a mostly algebraic theory. There were still the 
integral formulas around for which one can also make sense of convergence, but 
as already said, on has to restrict the class of functions, which one can 
multiply drastically, for example to the Schwartz space. However, these two 
articles were the starting point for what has now become a rich and fruitful 
theory.



\subsection{A Mathematical Theory}
\label{subsec:chap2_MathTheory}
Deformation quantization is a good example for a mathematical theory, which is 
motivated by a physical idea. It is not really talking about a physical problem, 
since the world does not need to be quantized -- it already is. It is talking 
about a mathematical problem: how to recover the quantized (and very counter-
intuitive) mathematics, which describe the world out of the classical (and much 
more intuitive) mathematics, which describe the world on our scale? Deformation 
quantization tries to give an answer to that, but unfortunately is (at its 
present state) still far from doing so completely. Like many such theories, it 
started of from a more or less precise physical background and developed into 
something quite different: a mostly algebraic, purely mathematical theory. That 
is also a bit due to the fact that the questions, which had to be answered in 
the beginning, were very hard and took a lot of time. Meanwhile, mathematicians 
were interested in the purely mathematical aspect of the theory and started 
working on that. We want to give a short overview over those questions and their 
answers very briefly and point out a little the history of this theory.

\subsection{From Formal to Strict}
\label{subsec:chap2_Formal2Strict}
Three steps: Formal -> Strict -> Representations
Concepts of strict DQ (Rieffel vs. Waldmann,
meaning C* vs. Locally convex)
So far everything is Math, Physics would start after the last step, Maybe one day...
