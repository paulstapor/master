\section{The long way from formal to strict}
\label{sec:chap2_FormalStrict}

As we have already seen, the answer a mathematician would give to the question "What is (classical) mechanics?" is very closely linked to symplectic and, more generally, Poisson geometry. It is for this reason, that we will have a look at some basics of Poisson geometry. Of course, a systematic way to get a strict deformation quantization for every Poisson manifold would rather be a life's work and is by far beyond the reach of a master thesis. We have to restrict it to a special class of Poisson systems in order to get a viable challenge. Constant Poisson structures were already tackled by Stefan Waldmann and investigated more closely by Matthias Sch√∂tz in  and  respectively. Therefore, the next logical step is to attack linear Poisson structures.
